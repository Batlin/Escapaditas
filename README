ESCAPADITAS

This project has been a personal project that was even deployed using Heroku while I was studying at the university in order to improve my RoR skills (year 2010). Using RoR, you can implement complex things with really low effort. And this is a good example.

Escapaditas was a new social network where the users can share with others their experiences as travellers so everybody could check here all the information they need about their next travel, or even discover new things to do in their cities.

The project was almost finished. The models are complete, the auth module was also working. Pending things are: improve the UI and localization (support for different languages)

How to make it run?

You need:

- ruby 1.9.3+
- Rails 3.0.7
- sqlite3 3.8.6+

Clone this repository. Then, install all the gems using 'bundle install'. Run 'bundle exec rake db:migrate'. After that, run 'rails server' and then everything should be working fine!
